I am Shaokui WEI (魏少魁), an incoming **Assistant Professor** at the *School of Computing and Artificial Intelligence*, **Shanghai University of Finance and Economics**. Currently, I am visiting **The University of Texas at Dallas**. Previously, I was a Ph.D. candidate at the *School of Data Science*, **The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen (CUHKSZ)**, under the supervision of [**Professor Hongyuan Zha**](https://sds.cuhk.edu.cn/en/teacher/65). From **September 2021 to May 2024**, I also collaborated with [**Professor Baoyuan Wu**](https://sites.google.com/site/baoyuanwu2015/). I received my Bachelor's degree (ranked **No.1**, *first-class honor*) in **Electronic Information Engineering** from the *School of Science and Engineering*, CUHKSZ.

Research
======
My research interests mainly lie in AI Security and Fairness, Computer Vision and Optimization, but also include Kernel Methods, Reinforcement Learning, and the application of Machine Learning in economics/marketing.

<span style="color:#4169E1;">
<em>
I am currently seeking opportunities for academic collaboration. If you find my research interests aligned with yours—be it in AI Security, Fairness, Computer Vision, or interdisciplinary applications—I would be delighted to connect and explore potential joint projects.
