I am currently a Ph.D. candidate in the School of Data Science (SDS), the Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen (CUHKSZ) under the supervision of **Professor Hongyuan Zha** and **Professor Baoyuan Wu**. Previously, I received my Bachelor's degree (rank No.1, first-class honor) in Electronic Information Engineering from the School of Science and Engineering (SSE), CUHKSZ. 


Research
======
My research interests mainly lie in AI Security and Fairness, Computer Vision and Optimization, but also include Kernel Methods, Reinforcement Learning, and the application of Machine Learning in economics/marketing.
